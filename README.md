# Project Completion Report

## Project Overview
- **Project Start Date:** 13.06
- **Project Completion Date:** 01.08

This project was completed over a span of two months, from its inception on June 13th to its finalization on August 1st. The primary goal of this project was to develop an admin panel using PHP and React.

## Skills Acquired
Throughout the course of this project, I gained experience in several key areas:
- **Admin Panel Development:** Successfully built a CRUD-based admin panel.
- **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Gained an understanding of how backend and frontend systems interact.
- **Build Tools and Technologies:**
  - **Gulp:** Automated tasks and managed development workflows.
  - **SCSS:** Enhanced CSS styling capabilities.
  - **Webpack:** Module bundling and asset management.


## Installation and Setup Instructions
1. **Local Server Setup:**  
   - Use any local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP) to host the project files.
   - If you plan to run the development environment, ensure that the correct path to the `admin` file is set in the `gulpfile`.
   
2. **Dependency Installation:**  
   - Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Starting Development Server:**  
   - After installing dependencies, start the development server by running the `gulp` command.

## Future Plans
With the completion of this admin panel, I intend to shift my focus to other PHP/React projects. However, due to a busy work schedule, I am uncertain about the feasibility of undertaking complex or time-consuming projects in the near future.


### bug and fix:

1. in const dist you need to chose YOUR PATH; 
2. a bug has appeared that even gulp/npm won’t let me run, I’ve been fiddling with it for half an hour and nothing is working, I’m already tired after work today, and I still have to continue the activation strike, so I’ll just release this message and then delete it when I fix the bug or just switch to another device (he hasn't work on mac, on windows work very well now)

### Components

1. **choose-modal**
2. **confirm-modal**
3. **editor**
4. **editor-text**
5. **panel**
6. **spinner**

## React Admin Panel Description

This project is a web-based admin panel built with React. It allows administrators to manage web pages, create backups, and restore pages from backups. The project is structured to separate different concerns into their respective components and helper files, making it modular and maintainable.
